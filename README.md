## the page edit record
* change title to "Horiseon".
* change ```<div class="header">``` to ```<header>```, and also did the same for ```<nav>``` and ```<footer>```.
* set ```<body> min-width: 1350px;``` because if the page width lower than 1030px, the nav->links will go out-side the nav area, and if the page width lower than 1350px, the shape of content and benefits will be strange. I could possiblly to use flex or some box CSS feature to do that better, but for module 1, set the min-width is the better solution for me.
* change all the css selectors to id or class, no more like ```.header div li```.
* add some comment for css and html.
* change hero image from css background img to html page ```<img>``` element.
* add ```alt``` for all the ```<img>``` elements.
* consolidate some css redundancy
* remove footer since there is no footer in Mock-UP
